## **DISCLAIMER**

**These study notes have been generated by AI, so they may be completely inaccurate, even though I asked it very nicely NOT to hallucinate.**

**Rely on it at your own risk, the goal of v1 of these notes is just to get as much coverage as possible, with future plans to refine and fully test for accuracy.**

**Also, it's entirely possible the exam guide and structure will change occasionally if not frequently, so there's that too.**

**ENJOY :D**

## Overview

The purpose of this preparatory material is as a resource to fill in knowledge gaps to address niche and specific knowledge required to accurately answer scenarios presented by the VIP exam.

Most good WordPress developers will know roughly what to do in each scenario, but some questions are nuanced and/or are somewhat subjective requiring  that invaluable real-world experience, which aligns with it's target of around 3-5 years of WordPress experience.

This is a fairly arbitrary range though, as it really depends on what you're exposed to within those years.
If you're just building small business sites with Elementor, you're unlikely to know why transients are expiring before their expiry when an object cache is being used, for example.

A lot of the questions are common sense though, which is nice.

But can I remember how to do `LEFT JOIN` statement in SQL and use `EXPLAIN` to understand query performance off the top of my head, probably not.

Reviewing these study notes should provide answers to these more specific questions.

## Optional Local Setup

If you'd like, you can run `composer install` to clone in the `/wordpress` directory.

The only reason this is included is so that it can be indexed by agents when writing docs, so it's not necessary.
